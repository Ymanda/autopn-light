Into 3 hours.I will be in the station in Rennes to take you Sophie would be with you or not ?Does she take a train before, or a plane ?What may I do for Her ?\nTGV station is in the terminal 2 ,I think you arrive in terminal 2 with AIR FRANCE.The station is very well indicated, near terminal 2E, ( don't take R.E.R. which goes in Paris ) - take TGV which goes around Paris -\nPrint the tickets for control,and got the real tickets from GREAT YELLOW SETS, introducing the code , which is in the circle.You note your wagon = N16and seats= N25 and 26and the hour of start = 18h48( be 3 mns before starting because the train don't stop for a long time ( coming from belgium, and going to rennes )\nYou have to \"composter\" , it is introduce in LITTLE YELLOW SET, before going down on the rail way.\nI hope you have a nice trip !maryvonne\nps :  don't forget little bags for drages, because now it's too late to got that ( they sold only drages whithout bags ) - you need 50 bags; for chidren I bought sweets;"
