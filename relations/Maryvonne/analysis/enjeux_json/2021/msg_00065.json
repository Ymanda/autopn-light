During the holidays or when Tristan is sick, I try to limit the time spent playing video games.  This by doing French lessons and games.  The hours fixed were from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. or from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m., which makes for Tristan from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. or 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.  It also allows me to do my activities.  It's still winter, we can't walk late with my neighbor, because it's too cold ... If you want to change the hours, I can start earlier, call, I'm home.  We are confined to 10 kms.\nTlcharger Outlook pour Android"
